 * interface computation, all nullability and requiredness annotations are
 * ignored, and the [Never] type is treated as [Null].
 * @description Check that when choosing the most specific method signature
 * during interface computation, all nullability annotations are ignored in
 * unmigrated library for the class method return value if it is not [null]
