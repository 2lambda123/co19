/// @assertion Currently you can do instantiated tear-offs of instance methods.
/// We restrict that to interface methods, which precisely excludes the call
/// methods of function types. We do not allow instantiating function values,
/// and therefore also cannot allow side-stepping that restriction by
/// instantiation the .call "instance" method of such a value.
///
/// That makes it a compile-time error to explicitly instantiate the call method
/// of an expression with a function type or of type Function, and the tear-off
/// of a call method of a function type is not subject to implicit instantiation
/// (so the tear-off is always generic, even if the context type requires it not
/// to be, which is then guaranteed to introduce a type error).
///
/// @description Checks that it is a compile-time error to tear-off a call
/// method of a generic function type using super.
