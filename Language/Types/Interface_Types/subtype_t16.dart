 * @assertion A type T is more specific than a type S, written T << S, if T is a type parameter and S is the upper bound of T.
 * << is a partial order on types. T is a subtype of S, written T <: S, iff [âŠ¥/Dynamic]T << S.
 * A type T may be assigned to a type S, written T <=> S, if either T <: S or S <: T.
 * @description Checks assignability (no static warnings) of S and T where T is type parameter and S is it's upper bound.
 * Note: detailed checks are contained in tests for the next assertion.
