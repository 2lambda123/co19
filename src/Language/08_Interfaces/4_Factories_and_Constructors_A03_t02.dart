 * @assertion Let I be an interface named NI with factory class F, and let NF be the
 * name of F. It is a compile-time error if I and F do not have the same number
 * of type parameters. If I has n type parameters, then the name of the ith type
 * parameter of I must be identical to the name of the ith type parameter of F ,
 * for i âˆˆ 1..n, or a compile-time error occurs.
 * @description Checks that it is a compile-time error if an interface 
 * has more type parameters than its declared factory class if the latter implements the former.
