/**
 * @assertion Evaluation of an identifier expression e of the form id proceeds as follows:
 * Let d be the innermost declaration in the enclosing lexical scope whose name
 * is id. If no such declaration exists in the lexical scope, let d be the declaration
 * of the inherited member named id if it exists.
 * ...
 * â€¢ If d is a type parameter T , then the value of e is the value of the actual
 *   type argument corresponding to T that was passed to the generative constructor that
 *   created the current binding of this.
 * @description  Checks that there is no compile-time error if identifier
 * expression in a return statement refers to a type parameter.
