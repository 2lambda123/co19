 * << is a partial order on types. T is a subtype of S, written T <: S, iff [âŠ¥/Dynamic]T << S.
 * A type T may be assigned to a type S, written T <=> S, if either T <: S or S <: T.
 * @description Checks the assignability (both ways) of variables and values that meet the described requirements.
 * This is a test of static checker, as it's a type error in checked mode when variable is assigned a value whose
