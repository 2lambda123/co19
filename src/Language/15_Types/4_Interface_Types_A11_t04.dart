 * @assertion A type T is more specific than a type S, written T << S, if T << U and U << S.
 * << is a partial order on types. T is a subtype of S, written T <: S, iff [âŠ¥/Dynamic]T << S.
 * A type T may be assigned to a type S, written T <=> S, if either T <: S or S <: T .
 * @description Checks that if type T is a subtype of S1 and S2 where S1 <: S<G1> and S2 <: S<G2> then
 * T is a subtype of S<G1> as well as S<G2> and every other supertype of S.
