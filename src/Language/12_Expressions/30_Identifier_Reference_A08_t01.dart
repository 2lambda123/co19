 * @assertion Evaluation of an identifier expression e of the form id proceeds as follows:
 * Let d be the innermost declaration in the enclosing lexical scope whose name
 * is id. If no such declaration exists in the lexical scope, let d be the declaration
 * of the inherited member named id if it exists.
 * ...
 * â€¢ If d is the declaration of a library variable or top-level getter, then
 * e is equivalent to the getter invocation id.
 * @description  Checks that references to a library variables is evaluated correctly
 * and that initializer expression is evaluated only once.
